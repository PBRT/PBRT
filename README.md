### React ES6 website

My personnal website using ES6 synthax built with :
  * [Stylus preprocessing](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
  * [Stylus export loader] (https://github.com/PBRT/stylus-export-loader)
  * [Webpack building and webpack dev server](http://webpack.github.io/)
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
  * [React Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion)
  * [VelocityJS](http://julian.com/research/velocity/)
  * [Bootstrap (imported with webpack)](https://github.com/gowravshekar/bootstrap-webpack)
  * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
  * Global UI kit
  * Media queries with React Context

This website is using my own kickstarter [ReacToGo](https://github.com/PBRT/reactogo).

# Motivation

Having a beautiful website and learn new technologies and synthax. Also learning how to build from scratch and deploy
and React application in a isomorphic way.

# TODO

Implement the isomorphic behaviour.

# Deployment

My personal website is available at [http://pbrt.co](http://pbrt.co).
